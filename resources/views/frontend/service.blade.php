                            ASLOOB BEDAA CONSTRUCTION (ABC) COMPANY Provide the Building construction process such as a
                            building, bridge, or other infrastructure,
                            from a set of design plans and specifications. Building construction involves different
                            stages of work that are executed by OUR Expert engineers
                            and supervisors. The major pre-construction work is done by the architect, structural
                            designer, and management team.
                            ABC planning in building construction involves three major steps: Developing the Building
                            Plan; Analysing the Finance;
                            Selecting the Construction Team. The vast majority of building construction projects are
                            small renovations, such as addition
                            of a room, or renovation of a bathroom. Often, the owner of the property acts as laborer,
                            paymaster, and design team for the entire Project.
